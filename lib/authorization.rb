  # Single entry point to authorisation checks for instances of objects and
  # also classes of objects.
  #
  # Options:
  #
  # :action      - This string describes the action to be performed, e.g.
  #                'create', 'read', 'update' or 'destroy'.
  #
  # :object      - This is the object being acted upon, e.g. an instance of a
  #                Comment or an instance of a Workflow.
  #
  # :object_type - As an alternative to an instance of an object, you can
  # :object_id     specify the type and id instead and this might not cause
  #                the object to be loaded into memory.
  #
  # :model       - If the action is performed on a class of objects, such as
  #                creating a Workflow, then specify the class of the object
  #                to be acted upon instead of an instance.  This is a class
  #                object, e.g. Workflow.
  #
  # :user        - The user that the check is with respect to.  Typically,
  #                this would be current_user.
  #
  # :context     - This is the context in which the object or object to be
  #                created is made.  For example, pack entries can only be
  #                created by those that can edit the pack that the entry will
  #                be made in, so the context here would be an instance of the
  #                pack in question.  This is only usually required for
  #                'create' actions.
