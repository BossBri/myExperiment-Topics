Generating A Public Data Version of the myExperiment Database
-------------------------------------------------------------

There is a PHP script in lib/maintenance called GeneratePublicData.php.
This is designed to produce a version of the myexperiment database that 
can be distributed to 3rd party developers so that they can develop 
their own apps.  This script is currently in development and therefore
may not yet remove all private data.  Below is a set of instructions on 
how to use the script.

(1) Open lib/maintenance/GeneratePublicData.php in a editor and set the
user, password, database, server and salt* variables.  Also ensure that the path
of php is set correctly, this path is in the first line of the file.

(2) If you are running the script of Linux ensure user execute privileges 
are set and then use the following command:

   ./GeneratePublicData.php

If you are running this script on an non-linux based system you may need
the following command:

  <fullpath>/php GeneratePublicData.php

Where <fullpath> is where the PHP executable is located.

(3) When the script runs it will prompt you for a password.  This is the
same as the one that you set in (1).

(4) Once the script has finished it should have created a file entitled
myexp_public.sql in the directory as the script.  Import this into an blank
database (i.e. no data or tables) in your own copy of mysql.

*salt is required to hash a user's ID in way which prevents someone from
being able to work which hash corresponds to which user through a brute force 
attack.  Salts should be treated like passwords, i.e. you don't tell anyone 
else what salt you used and you choose something that is hard to guess.
